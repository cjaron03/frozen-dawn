    "VASQUEZ PERSONAL LOG:\n\nShutting down locally makes\nit worse. The remaining\nnodes compensate by drawing\nmore power, which accelerates\ntheir own failure.\n\nORSA can no longer be\ndisabled piecemeal.",
    "Local shutdown attempts\namplified orbital instability.\n\nThis is irreversible.\n\nThe math is clear. Even if\nevery node came back online\ntoday, the orbital momentum\ncannot be corrected.",
    "Geothermal stabilization\nnodes are the last option.\n\nGo deep. The thermal anchors\ncan create bubbles of\nsurvivability.\n\nI'm heading underground.\nI suggest you do the same.\n\n-E.V.",
    "POST-SCRIPT:\n\nThe relay satellites launched\nlast week. Seven of them.\nProject Lighthouse.\n\nThey'll keep listening even\nafter the last node goes\ndark. Even after we leave.\n\nIf someone builds the\ntransponder, the satellites\nwill hear it.\n\nI don't know if anyone will\nbe left to try.\n\nBut at least the sky is\nlistening.\n\n-E.V."
