    "FIELD REPORT 7-X\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET\n\nFROM: Dr. Elena Vasquez\n\nOrbital deviation now visible\nto civilian astronomers.\nCover story approved:\n\"Solar minimum event.\"\n\nEnergy loss: 0.4%/yr,\ncompounding.",
    "FIELD TECHNICIAN LOG\nRelay Station B-7\n\nSubterranean array hums\ndifferently now. Pitch\ndropped maybe two tones\nsince last month.\n\nThermal anchor prototypes\nholding at 4C above ambient.\nSmall mercy.",
    "[REDACTED] COMMITTEE EXCERPT\n\nNode cascade risk elevated\nto CATEGORY 3.\n\nStabilization infrastructure\nmust be expanded underground.\nSurface installations are\nno longer viable beyond\nphase 2 projections.",
    "VASQUEZ ADDENDUM:\n\nThe underground relays are\nour only realistic option.\n\nI've started calling them\n\"geothermal stabilization\nnodes.\" The committee prefers\n\"thermal anchors.\"\n\nI don't care what we call\nthem. They need to work.",
    "ADDENDUM (CLASSIFIED):\n\nSeparately, Engineering has\nproposed a deep-band relay\nnetwork. Seven satellites in\nhigh orbit, listening for a\nspecific frequency.\n\nThey're calling it\n\"Project Lighthouse.\"\n\nThe idea is simple: if\nsomeone survives long enough\nto build a transponder,\nthe satellites relay the\nsignal to Mars.\n\nI approved the funding.\nThe committee doesn't know."
